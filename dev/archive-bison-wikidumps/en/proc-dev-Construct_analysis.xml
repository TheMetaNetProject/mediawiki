Needs notion of Resources (which is inherently purpose-driven). Money is about Resources. Money is a resource for resources. Poverty is a lack of resources, by being a lack of a resource (money) for those resources.

What are the metaphors and framings surrounding poverty?
Well-being frame: The goal of getting out of poverty is flourishing. Types of well-being include: wealth, health, education, happiness, respect (positive social status), self-esteem, etc. Frames and metaphors pick out different ones of the latter.

E.g.: Access to education is a special case of having a path with no impediments to education as a form of well-being and a resource for other forms of well-being.

Inferences about being in poverty:
1. Have difficulty getting the forms of well-being
2. There are forces acting on you / lead you to forms of ill-being, e.g., gang membership, depression. (But gang-membership is a way to get social status/resources/wealth.)

Or, it may be related to examples such as 'the burden of heavy backpacks', which might also be expressed as 'heavy backpacks are a burden'.  Similarly, we have patterns like 'the elected office of president', and president is an elected office'.  It is unclear how exactly to characterize the semantic relations expressed in these examples.

|text=burden of taxation
|informalanalysis=This N(S)of N(T) construct expresses an entity-to-entity role mapping within the TAXATION IS A BURDEN metaphor, namely that between the 'burden' role in the Burden frame, and 'tax' role in the Taxation frame.

To 'automatically' identify the relevant source and target roles involved here, it seems like we would have to associate the LUs to their relevant frame roles (e.g. burden.n, load.n would be linked to the  'burden' role of Burden frame, and taxation.n and tax.n would be linked to the 'tax' role of the Taxation frame).

Note that both of the 'N' constituents can include modifiers, e.g 'heavy burden of unfair taxation'
|comment=This mapping can also be expressed using the NP(T)copula NP(S) cxn (e.g. Taxes are a burden).

We need to define which subcase of N_of_N this is.  It may be that it is exclusively metaphorical (unlike, e.g. Part_of_whole, or Container_of_Contents N_of_N cxns). Or, it may be related to examples such as 'the burden of heavy backpacks', which might also be expressed as 'heavy backpacks are a burden'.  Similarly, we have patterns like 'the elected office of president', and president is an elected office'.  It is unclear how exactly to characterize the semantic relations expressed in these examples.
