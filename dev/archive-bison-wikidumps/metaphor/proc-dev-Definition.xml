|Description=Categories are conceptual units, structured internally by prototype-extension relations among its members (ranging in inclusivity from prototypical to peripheral) and externally by taxonomic relations between categories.  Categorization about the world happens via inductive reasoning.  Because categories are formed for things that are relevant, or “matter”, to the people of a community, the meanings of most categories tend to be vague and fleeting, and the borderlines between categories are fuzzy.
Categories occur in hierarchies, with superordinate-subordinate relations according to saliency, and in particular whole-part relations.  Basic level categories are conceptually more salient than categories at the higher and lower levels, and tend to elicit the most responses and richest images because they provide the most maximally necessary information.  Most categories have a prototype structure, and as such categories are understood in terms of their prototypes. This inherent superordinate-subordinate relation gives rise naturally to metonymy.

|Entry=Cognitive Primitive
|Other Aliases=Cog
|Description=Cognitive primitives are simple conceptual building blocks formed in infancy, and are often associated with an image schema.  Cognitive primitives can be incorporated by image schemas.  However, cognitive primitives are unlike frames and image schemas in that they lack internal structure, and so cannot form gestalts.

|Description=Cognitive primitives are simple conceptual building blocks formed in infancy, and are often associated with an image schema.  Cognitive primitives can be incorporated by image schemas.  However, cognitive primitives are unlike frames and image schemas in that they lack internal structure, and so cannot form gestalts.

|Entry=Linguistic Metaphor
|Other Aliases=LM
|Description=A linguistic metaphor is an instantiation of, or linguistically mediated instance of, a more general conceptual metaphor.  Linguistic metaphors occur when words for source domain concepts are used for target domain concepts via metaphoric mappings.  Linguistic metaphors activate a conceptual metaphor, but they do not alter it.  (e.g. in the nominal clause "epidemic of poverty," the target domain concept Poverty is described using the source domain lexeme 'epidemic,' evoking the linguistic metaphor POVERTY IS AN EPIDEMIC. The use of the lexeme 'epidemic' evokes the more general Disease frame, which activates the more general conceptual metaphor POVERTY IS A DISEASE).

|Entry=Metaphor Relation Type
|Description=In the Wiki, metaphors are listed along with information that contextualizes and relates the metaphor to other metaphors, either more generic metaphors from which it inherits or related metaphors which it commonly uses or is co-activated with. For instance, under the entry for the metaphor ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS A JOURNEY, the metaphors PURPOSES ARE DESTINATIONS and ACTION IS MOTION are listed, and are each given a 'Relation type' relative to ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS A JOURNEY. ''The current possible relation types are:'' 1. is both a source and target subcase of, 2. is a source subcase of, 3. is a target subcase of, 4. is a mapping within, 5. makes use of, 6. has a transitive subpart, 7. is an entailment of. When in doubt, the following relations are also available when entering a metaphor in the Wiki: 8. is in some source relation to, 9. is in some target relation to, 10. is in some way related to.

|Description=Frames, both cogs and frames, are given roles (as many as are needed to understand the frame inferences, and as detailed as need be in terms of naming). When frames appear in a metaphor mapping, the same roles as were listed for that frame in its frame form entry appear in the metaphor mapping. Generally, the roles are assigned names that make them maximally relevant to and reflective of the frame they are roles of, and maximally distinct from the more generic frame from which they inherit.

|Description=Roles are used to represent the internal structure of Frames.  

Within Metaphor  entries, roles are used to define role mappings between the Source frame and the Target Frame; the same roles as were listed for that frame in its frame form entry are used in the metaphor mapping. (see [[Mapping]])

A given Frame’s roles are listed in the ‘Roles’ block of the Frame page.   Filling out this section is optional, but strongly preferred.  When a frame is defined as a ‘subcase of’ another frame, it is generally assumed that it inherits all the roles of that other frame, even if these roles are not actually listed in the roles section of the current frame.

Roles are commonly assigned names that make them maximally relevant to and reflective of the frame they are roles of, and maximally distinct from the more generic frame from which they inherit. However, each role name is defined in relation to a particular frame.  Therefore, it is possible to use the same role name in more than one frame; for instance, the ‘experiencer’ role in the Anger frame is distinct from (though related to) the ‘experiencer’ role in the Emotion frame. 

Each role can be assigned a Type.  Currently, these are text fields that are used to indicate whether a given role is, e.g., some kind of entity, an x-schema (process), or state/property.   The Glossary/Comments field can provide further, more elaborated information about a given role.  Where applicable, a given frame role entry can also specify which of the FrameNet roles (FE, in FrameNet terminology) in the closest FrameNet frame it most closely corresponds to (see [[Closest FrameNet Frames]]). 
     
Relations between the current frame’s roles and those of other related frames are specified in the the Bindings section of the Frame page (see [[Binding]]).

|Description=An ICM is a concept, or a cluster of related concepts, that defines our knowledge of a category.  An ICM is comprised of those features which most strongly characterize the category.  Members of a category who most strongly fit the definition imposed by the ICM are called prototypes.  For example, the ICM for the category bird includes an feathered animal, with two wings, that can fly, that has a beak and talons, and can lay eggs.  A prototypical bird would be something like a pigeon or sparrow, while a less prototypical bird would be something like a chicken or an ostrich.

|Description=When talking about metaphors, we use the term 'map' to refer to the correspondence between frames or domains as opposed to the correspondence between their frame elements (which is referred to as 'mappings'). For instance ARGUMENT IS WAR is a metaphor map, and 'words are weapons' would be one of its many mappings. The metaphor receives a name in the TARGET IS SOURCE format, where the terms chosen for the TARGET and SOURCE in that particular metaphor name are maximally informative of the metaphor itself, rather than of its entailments or mappings.

|Entry=Inference
|Description=The detailed knowledge about a frame or frame that constitutes the internal logic of that frame or frame by which we reason about that frame or frame; inferences fall out from our understanding of a frame or frame given the constraints on that frame or frame. Traditionally, inference and entailment are synonymous. In the Wiki, inference is kept to refer to the internal logic of a frame or frame, while entailment is used to refer to the corresponding logic in the target domain in a metaphoric mapping.

|Other Aliases=Image Frametic Domain
|Description=Image schemas are prelinguistic representations of highly frametic patterns arising from imagistic domains of sensory-motor experience that recur in a variety of embodied domains (e.g. containers, paths, forces, scalarity, balance, locomotion).  Image schemas, as embodied structures, have a psychological reality, are internally structured, and motivate conceptual metaphor mappings.

|Entry=Family
|Description=Each frame can (optionally) be specified to be a member of one or more Frame families.  Similarly, each metaphor is (optionally) defined to be a member of one or more Metaphor families.

Families are used to group related frames/metaphors together, e.g. for ease of analyzing a particular semantic domain or set of metaphors.    

Lists of Frame Families and Metaphor Families can be accessed via links listed under the Metaphor Data Guide section of the Main page of the Wiki. 
Clicking on a given family name provides access to a list of the frames/metaphors that have been specified to be members of that family, as well as a diagram that illustrates the defined relations between these  frames/metaphors.  For frame families, there is also a list of the LUs associated with each of the frames.

|Description=A binding is a circuit that links two or more entities. Types of bindings include role-filler and entity-to-entity bindings (e.g., anaphora). There is also a binding between the entity created by the role-filler binding and a role in an x-schema.

Within Frame pages, the Bindings field is used to specify bindings between a given role in the current frame and one or more roles in the Frame(s) listed in the "Related Frames" block.  Dot notation is used to specify the Related frame role.  E.g. if the Related frame is Action, a binding to its 'actor' role is specified as "Action.actor".

Within Frame pages, the Bindings field is used to specify bindings between a given role in the current frame and one or more roles in the Frame(s) listed in the "Related Frames" block.  Dot notation is used to specify the Related frame role. And the binding relation itself is specified using a "=" sign.  

 E.g. if the current frame is "Self propelled motion" (which includes a 'self_mover' role), and a related frame is "Action" (which includes an 'actor' role), a relevant binding would be:  self_mover = Action.actor

|Description=A binding is a circuit that links two or more entities. Types of bindings include role-filler and entity-to-entity bindings (e.g., anaphora). There is also a binding between the entity created by the role-filler binding and a role in an x-schema.

Within Frame pages, the Bindings field is used to specify bindings between a given role in the current frame and one or more roles in the Frame(s) listed in the "Related Frames" block.  Dot notation is used to specify the Related frame role. And the binding relation itself is specified using a "=" sign.  

For instance, if the current frame is "Self propelled motion" (which includes a 'self_mover' role), and a related frame is "Action" (which includes an 'actor' role), a relevant binding would be:  self_mover = Action.actor

|Description=A conceptual metaphor is a mapping between frames that arise from our embodied experiences.  The core of the conceptual network of metaphors are primary metaphors.  Though primary metaphors are thought to consist of experientially-based universals, it is the case that many conceptual metaphors are composed of relations between culturally-constrained semantic frames (e.g. ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS A JOURNEY).

|Entry=Generic Metaphor
|Other Aliases=General metaphor; Higher metaphor; Domain-level metaphor
|Description=This is the most generic level metaphor, and it often does not come in a TARGET IS SOURCE format in the literature. How we treat these from now on is still being debated, but we are thinking it's best perhaps that these are their own metaphors with their own roles, and of which other metaphors are instances. For instance MIND IS BODY is a higher/generic/domain-level metaphor and has instances such as SENSING IS SMELLING, etc. Other ways to treat these metaphors are: they are supermetaphors that define domains, they are generalizations over other metaphors and they are not basic embodied metaphors in and of themselves. In category terms, they are superordinate and not basic level.
